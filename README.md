# python-calculator
aim:
making a working simple calculator using function block and dictionaries

algorithm:
1. creating a basic arithmatic function (add, subtract, multiply, division) under the main function (ex: def calculator(num1, num2, operation)
2. creating a dictionary to map 'operation' to functions, allowing users to call the appropriate function based on the input.
3. check if the operation chosen is correct. if not, display an error
4. taking input from user (num1, num2, operation
5. calling the calculator function and print the results
